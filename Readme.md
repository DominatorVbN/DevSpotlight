# DevSpotlight - A Multiplatform SwiftUI App



DevSpotlight is a multiplatform app that provides the latest tech news. It is built using SwiftUI and targets both macOS and iOS platforms. The app uses Supabase as its database to store and retrieve tech news articles. In order to set up the app, you will need to create a `Secrets.swift` file to securely store your Supabase host and API key.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use DevSpotlight, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Supabase Account**: You should have a Supabase account and a project set up.

2. **Database Tables**: You need to create the following tables in your Supabase project and populate them with data:

   - `SidebarOptions`: This table stores options for the app's sidebar menu.
   - `SidebarSections`: This table stores sections for the sidebar.
   - `Spotlights`: This table stores tech news articles.

   Please refer to the provided database schema below for table structure details.

3. **Supabase API Key**: You should generate an API key from your Supabase project settings. This API key will be used to access your Supabase project from the app.

## Setting up Secrets.swift

In order to keep your Supabase credentials secure, you need to create a `Secrets.swift` file in your Xcode project. This file should contain the following structure:

```swift
struct Secrets {
    static let supabaseHost = "YOUR_SUPABASE_HOST"
    static let supabaseAPIKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_API_KEY"
}
```

Replace `"YOUR_SUPABASE_HOST"` and `"YOUR_SUPABASE_API_KEY"` with your Supabase project's host URL and API key.

**Note:** Make sure to add `Secrets.swift` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent your sensitive information from being pushed to version control.

## Database Schema

Here is the schema for the tables you need to create in your Supabase project:

### SidebarOptions Table

```sql
sqlCopy code
create table
  public."SidebarOptions" (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    icon character varying not null,
    name character varying not null,
    section_id uuid null,
    tag text null,
    constraint SidebarOptions_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint SidebarOptions_section_id_fkey foreign key (section_id) references "SidebarSections" (id),
    constraint SidebarOptions_tag_fkey foreign key (tag) references "Tags" (tag)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

### SidebarSections Table

```sql
sqlCopy code
create table
  public."SidebarSections" (
    id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    name character varying not null,
    constraint Sidebar.Sections_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

### Spotlights Table

```sql
sqlCopy code
create table
  public."Spotlights" (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    by character varying not null,
    title text not null,
    "imageURL" text not null,
    "articleURL" text not null,
    tags text[] not null,
    constraint News_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

## Running the App

Once you have set up your `Secrets.swift` file and created the required database tables, you can run the DevSpotlight app on both macOS and iOS platforms using Xcode.
